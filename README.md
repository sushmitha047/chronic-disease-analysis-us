# Chronic Disease Analysis: Trends, Demographics, and Public Health Insights

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of chronic diseases in the United States, focusing on trends, demographics, and public health implications. The project utilizes data from the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) dataset to provide valuable insights into major health concerns such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.

## Key Findings

- **Cancer**: Leads in age-adjusted prevalence among all CDI topics, with highest incidence among White ethnic groups and males.
- **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)**: Prevalence increases dramatically after age 65, affecting one in three individuals by age 75.
- **Diabetes**: Significant variations observed across different racial groups.

## Repository Contents

1. `ChronicDiseaseAnalysis-pptx.pdf`: Presentation slides detailing the analysis and findings.
2. `Chronic_Diseases.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis code and visualizations.

## Highlights

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizes extensive CDC data to provide actionable public health information.
- **Visualizations**: Includes charts and graphs for easy interpretation of complex health data.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Breaks down disease prevalence by race, gender, and age groups.
- **Public Health Implications**: Offers insights into prevention strategies and risk factors.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## Key Takeaways

1. Early detection and awareness programs are crucial, especially for cancer prevention.
2. CVD risk increases significantly with age, emphasizing the need for lifestyle interventions.
3. Diabetes shows varying prevalence among different racial groups, highlighting the importance of targeted health initiatives.

## Future Work
